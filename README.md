## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

While working on the project, I had the opportunity to learn more about masonry layout and to challenge myself to realise this particular layout.
I built the slideshow using the "Embla-carousel" library, focusing on how to realise the layout using CSS-grid and making it responsive.
